        <div class="designDescription">The main purpose of this mood board was to capture the essence of what I wanted my brand to look and feel. To aid in my design process, I chose the key word “cottage core” as inspiration. “Cottage core” was a term popularized on Tik Tok during the pandemic and describes a visual aesthetic incorporating florals, picnics, long dresses, rural living, baking, and etc. It is a concept that I personally love and wanted to incorporate into my own brand as it directly opposes “hustle” culture and capitalism. It speaks to a simpler and more intentional way of living, which I wanted my brand to embody. In choosing the specific images above, I was also keeping my ideal client in mind which included: not-for-profit organizations, lifestyle and wellness brands, micro influencers, restaurants, and other small businesses.</div>

    <h2 class="designTitle">the logo</h2>

    <div class="description">
      <div class="designDescription">Prior to U for Change, I had already made a logo using a font I purchased on Creative Market. It was an easy solution for someone who wasn’t familiar with Adobe Illustrator, but ultimately,  was not unique. I knew I wanted to challenge myself in creating a logo with a font already included in the Adobe Creative Suite subscription. Before starting, I kept in mind that I wanted a logo that was timeless, even twenty years down the road.  I experimented with different fonts and natural elements that could convey a floral aesthetic. The logo I ended up choosing were my initials and the leaves curving around the letters. I was certain I would choose a logo with my full name, but I realize my name is quite long. I have already experienced in the past with my previous logo how difficult it can be to fit my full name onto a business card, while still keeping it legible. Ultimately, I chose this logo because of its simplicity and it’s timelessness. It truly best represents who I am as an illustrator and designer.</div>
